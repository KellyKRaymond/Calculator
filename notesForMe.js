// first I linked all my pages together, under a new project folder - JS, CSS, HTML so they could work together.

// I created a seperate DIV class for my game board so that on different screeens it will have set 
// diameters, rather than just a straight background that will change depending on the device 
// created a DIV class for my top and bottom rows called "outter rows"  inside my board game div class because they will be exact replicas
// and I will further format the inside, numbers and characters later on

// While formatting my game board, I had to pay close attention to where each "div class" started and ended, if I had as much as one closing div </> in the wrong place
// my formating would be off - so I was running into issues with my middle rows containing my bottom row - all because of a simple closing </>
// I had to make sure my div classes were lined up correctly so their was "parents" and "children" basically categories and 
// sub cateogies inside of them that I was able to keep together and change characteristics together. 

// I mapped out my week the day the assignment started, Tuesday I set up a draft of my calculator, set up my new folders and create my boxes (they didn't look pretty)
// Wednesday I spent the day formatting in CSS - making the tiles the size I wanted, a large center to put in other boxes etc. I got the exact color of a Monopoly board by using 
// the color dropper extension on google chrome 

// Thursday I spent the day only in Javascript - creating buttons and adding functions to tell the code when a button is pressed you must do XYZ  (show example)



// other things I want to add to add to my project as I become a more skilled developer is using the keypad, rather than just making everything clickable, picking your 
// character as one of the monopoly players for your cursor (shoe, boat, race car, dog, etc.) I also want to add colors to the boxes, and use my tiles on the 
// sides of my board to do more advance functions % etc
